Give Me The Dumbest Crypto Opinion You Can,"Hello everyone,

Lately, my boyfriend has been annoying me by arguing with me about things he knows nothing about. Since he‚Äôs obsessed with crypto, I thought it‚Äôd be fun to mess with him a little and I'm hoping you all can help. 

I need the dumbest crypto opinion you can think of. Give me something completely ridiculous but please include enough detail that I can be believable in a conversation with him. I don‚Äôt know anything about crypto, but I want to act like I suddenly have very strong (and very wrong, LOL) opinions on it.

Thanks in advance :)",Correct-Coconut-6311,2025-02-11 21:38:26,89,CryptoCurrency

"Nasdaq Files To List Xrp Etf, Stating Xrp Is Hard To Manipulate","Article in summary:
Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP‚Äôs decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†The ETF‚Äôs value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
‚Ä¢	‚Å†XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP‚Äôs market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP‚Äôs journey toward mainstream financial integration.

What'S Up With These Tap To Earn Tokens ?,"Lately, I keep seeing these ""tap to earn"" apps everywhere basically, you tap the screen, watch ads, or do random tasks to earn some kind of crypto or in-game token. At first, it seems like an easy way to stack up some extra cash, but after messing around with a few, I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs mostly a waste of time. But at the other end we can even make money lol if good luck. 
I‚Äôve noticed The payouts are tiny. You‚Äôd have to grind for weeks just to make a few bucks.
Withdrawal limits are insane. A lot of these apps won‚Äôt let you cash out until you hit some ridiculous threshold that most people will never reach.
Way too many ads. Half the time, you‚Äôre just watching endless ads for the chance to earn a few cents.
Some of them seem sketchy. A few apps never actually pay out, or they disappear after hyping up their tokens.
I feel like these apps are just farming user engagement and ad revenue while making it seem like you're earning something. Has anyone actually made decent money from one of these, or are they all just a trap? Curious to hear real experiences. Recently came accross tapswap. Before it was ton and midas yield which i tried . But kinda confused because So many are still coming in market.",Stunning-Ask3032,2025-02-11 16:34:20,7,CryptoCurrency

Crypto Taxes For A Beginner,"Hi everyone, I have some questions for the more experienced:

1) I got two AirDrops, about 1k each, sold on the same day, on one I lost $50 and on the other I made $100 profit, how should I report them?

2) I invested example: 5k in Solana, now I have a total value of 15k in sol‚Ä¶ I decide to sell 2k do I have to declare it anyway, even if it is less than what I invested and it is not a capital gain?

3) I have been DCA BTC for the past 3 years, small transactions of $100 a week, sold everything! 
but one of the exchanges I bought from no longer shows me how many BTC I bought and at what price‚Ä¶

I can declare like this: I invested 10,000, I sell for 15,000‚Ä¶15,000-1000=5,000 profit and I pay taxes!  Or do I always have to report the details of each individual transaction, the dates, etc.?

Thanks to whoever can help me!",ErBerto96,2025-02-11 14:42:46,0,CryptoCurrency
"Tether Transfer From Abroad, Taxes?","Hi there, noob in crypto here. Sorry if my English is bad sometimes. 

Tl;dr in advance: What‚Äôs the taxation on receiving about $1800 worth of tether on average monthly, from my brother in Turkey to me in the US? 

Here‚Äôs my situation and I‚Äôm trying to understand what sort of taxation I might have to deal with. 

I have assets abroad (in Turkey specifically) but I reside in the US (non-citizen, legal resident) and I want to transfer my monthly passive income that I have back there to here. It‚Äôs not much, about $1600 to $1900 each month. Using the regular bank to bank transfers I end up using about $1200 or more in a year due to horrible exchange rates and the fees. So my brother who‚Äôs a crypto enthusiast suggested that I use this method: 

I send him my Turkish Lira each month, he buys tether and transfers it to me in the US, and I transfer that into my regular bank account. So  basically a transfer from my Turkish bank account to my US bank account through a longer but supposedly cheaper way. That part seems to be accurate, but I‚Äôm wondering what my obligations are in terms of taxes. As far as chatgpt tells me, since it‚Äôs a transfer within family it can be considered a ‚Äúgift‚Äù, and if it doesn‚Äôt exceed the $18,000 annual gift tax exclusion, it‚Äôll be fine. But it does exceed the $18,000 limit. So will I be taxed on the amount after that limit, or does the whole total of transfer then gets deemed not a gift and get taxed? Also other than that, is there anything else that I need to consider?

Many thanks in advance to all who try to help. Happy gaining to you.",sultanamana,2025-02-11 18:22:35,0,CryptoCurrency
Are Memecoins A Money Glitch?,"So you make a memecoin on Solana and you make a liquidity pool with only 10% of all tokens and like 10 SOL. You keep 90% of the supply and slowly lock tokens into the LP. 

Steps after memecoin creation: 
1. promote the crap out of it 
2. use the trading fees to continually add to the liquidity pool 
3. Keep control of 40% of tokens 
4. 50% being in the lp and 10% circulating 

Could you eventually create coin with actual value? Is it possible to set an actual floor price for a memecoin?? Is there math that supports this?

Nobel Economist Labels Bitcoin ‚ÄúA Financial Black Hole‚Äù,""" Eugene F. Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, sees zero value in Bitcoin, calling it nothing but an empty vacuum.

Appearing on the Capitalis‚Äôt podcast, Eugene Fama delivered his verdict: Bitcoin is doomed. While the crypto world has heard plenty of these eulogies before, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds.

Fama ridiculed the idea of a blockchain-based financial system, likening it to boiling soup over a fire made from plastic bottles‚Äîexpensive, inefficient, and environmentally reckless. He sees Bitcoin as a wild card in monetary theory, unpredictable and undeserving of attention. And the idea that it‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù? He‚Äôs not buying it.¬†

‚ÄúCryptocurrencies are such a puzzle because they violate all the rules of a medium of exchange,‚Äù Fama said. ‚ÄúThey don't have a stable real value. They have highly variable real value. That kind of a medium of exchange is not supposed to survive,‚Äù he concluded.""

"Your Thoughts On The ""Stable"" Coin Usdn","I recently came across a new stable coin called USDN offered by a decentralized exchange platform named Smardex. It appears that they have a feature which allows users to swap Ethereum and potentially USDT to their proprietary stable coin, USDN. This caught my interest, and I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has encountered this before?

What makes USDN particularly intriguing is their advertised 58% APR just for holding the coin in your wallet. This is quite an attractive proposition, and it has piqued my interest significantly. However, I am a bit cautious, as it sounds almost too good to be true. I would like to give it a try, but I want to ensure it's a sound investment and not something that might lead me into complications or unforeseen issues down the line.

From what I understand, there are two main avenues to acquire USDN: you can either mint new USDN coins or swap existing cryptocurrencies to USDN. The prospect of such high returns is tempting, yet it‚Äôs crucial to assess the reliability and legitimacy of Smardex and their offerings. Before taking the plunge, I would like to gather more insights from others who might have experience with USDN to determine whether it‚Äôs genuinely worth the risk, or if it would be wiser to approach this offer with caution.

"Cboe Bzx Submits Filings For Xrp Etfs From Bitwise, Wisdomtree, Canary, And 21Shares.","Looks like the hype for xrp is gonna huge this bull run. 
Cboe BZX Exchange has filed requests with U.S. regulators to launch the first spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On February 6, the exchange submitted filings for four asset managers Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs would track the price of XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.
These filings notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about a proposed rule change. If approved, these would be the first XRP ETFs in the U.S.

Earlier, under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum were approved in early 2024.

Now, with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who is seen as more supportive of crypto, there has been an increase in crypto-related ETF filings. Analysts believe issuers are testing what new crypto products the SEC, possibly influenced by a Trump administration, might approve.

I think we are now getting a lot of adoption and attention towards crypto . Many more expectations from other major exchanges like bitget and kucoin regarding etfs.",Stunning-Ask3032,2025-02-10 22:04:21,3,CryptoCurrency

"The Crazy World Of Crypto, It'S Only Getting Worse","Crypto has been through ups and downs but honestly since 2017 when layer two tokens for Ethereum took off and DeFi came into existence it's only gotten more wild.

  
I'd have to say at least the first part of what would be considered a fun meme coin project would have been DOGE at least one that really took off and became one of the most adopted token. This was back in 2014, and before that I would say most projects where legitimate cases of blockchain such as litecoin.

From there things fell rather quite for a while until 2017 when Ethereum layer two tokens really took off. This layer two token system opened up a lot of possibilities but it also opened up a lot of failed projects and yes scam investments.

From there we then moved into 2020-2021 with the introduction of Meme coins, DeFi and NFT a rather large growth in terms of amount of projects and people getting involved.

 Now we are in 2024-2025 bull run and we have a lot of the same crazy going on but at a whole new level. We have meme coin crazy, scams, rug pulls, DeFi hacks, Layer two token projects, NFTs, web3, gaming and more. It's gotten so big now that not everything goes up.

Can Customers Actually Do Xrp-Based Money Transfers Through Conventional Banks?,"I'm from a country with a very archaic and anti-competitive banking system. From what I've read, at least one chain of major national banks has some affiliation to XRP, but I haven't seen anything about how to do faster and less expensive money transfers via XRP from that bank. XRP isn't mentioned anywhere on its website, and that got me wondering how banks even refer to XRP-based money transfers - to the extent that they acknowledge XRP or crypto to their customers at all.

Do any banks where you live actually let you transfer fiat money via XRP? If so, do they refer to such transactions as ""wire transfers,"" ""XRP money transfers,"" or something different? Also, wouldn't both the sending bank AND the receiving bank need to support XRP for this sort of transfer to go through?",bje332013,2025-02-10 01:12:05,68,CryptoCurrency

Telcoin - Not Enough Attention,"For a cryptocurrency company that has been a trailblazer in writing and passing a pro crypto bill in Nebraska to now being Conditionally approved to open the first US Digital Asset Bank charter - how does telcoin not get enough attention from the community? They will have access the Fed rails and provide crypto services to small banks and big banks alike. An actual use of cryptocurrency, yet many journalists, crypto news breakers don‚Äôt report about it. 

The government at the moment is very hot on stable coins, yet we now have the company telcoin that can now legally issue dollar backed stablecoins. They are planning for the US dollar, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, etc. the biggest remittance corridors there are, and yet we don‚Äôt spread the news? I mean, this is tech! Actual adoption and use of crypto. I just don‚Äôt get how they don‚Äôt have the CT backing or support from more people. It‚Äôs an older company that survived bear markets and is still building and it‚Äôs at its peak potential right now. And I haven even talked about telecoms, the telcoin network, and how the token is used in the systems they are soon releasing.

Polygon & The Super Bowl: From Reddit Avatars To Polymarket‚ÄôS $14M Bet,"Today I crossed with this interesting [Tweet ](https://x.com/p_petertherock/status/1888697925423055196)sharing data regarding the NFL Super Bowl on Polygon.

As you may know, two years ago Reddit had a Reddit Collectible Avatars marketing campaign for the NFL Super Bowl LVII and they gifted event related avatars to the users that claimed them. Like this one:

https://preview.redd.it/otzpr7cxe9ie1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c11a4bcb1012357f0045a9d85d05fa4b335dfe3

This whole event minted 2,124,854M Collectible avatars on Polygon Network. Unfortunately Reddit next year's Superbowl tried something similar but making them too expensive and not achieving that great success.

https://preview.redd.it/c8bpje8ye9ie1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cab97c93ac7dbe580b8c5584b3c01b2ac694c6c

This year unfortunately Reddit didn't organized any kind of Superbowl Reddit Collectible avatars related event but this time we have another protagonist, Polymarket.

Polymarket is making Polygon once again the center of the action in this Super Bowl LIX with $14 million in active positions across 478 Super Bowl related markets.

https://preview.redd.it/8f4j0vcze9ie1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d8ea4f64ae9bf83243e247b50eab8bb720ee9d0

Polymarket is having +$414M in betting volume as you can see in the image below.

https://preview.redd.it/0ezm6db0f9ie1.png?width=2866&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ed80ca307de721aead71c5cc9a0fadedeb4a61

Polygon continues to cement its presence at the NFL Super Bowl, and this time, it‚Äôs through **Polymarket**, the popular decentralized prediction market.

https://preview.redd.it/ufc4f8yoa9ie1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac766257a4ac5282666da10bacf6056bb6815594

Polymarket is really gamblers paradise xD

With all of this I just want to show that Polygon has probably one of the most used real use of cases even if it is a casino and its bringing a lot of money and people to Polygon ecosystem building a unstoppable ecosystem that pushes adoption in crypto. And this is just the beginning because one AggLayer starts being operative it will be easier than ever to move money between layers to participate on fun dApps like Polymarket. Polygon is about to wake up.

Why Everything Positive You'Ve Heard About Crypto Is A Trick,"When you ask a crypto holder what they actually own in the amount shown in their wallet, they will likely say something like ""an asset"" or ""a store of value."" But that‚Äôs not true. The fact is, they own nothing. They hold a number but own nothing.

To understand why, let‚Äôs first clarify what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value.

Imagine you are holding 500 units of wheat. In this case, you don‚Äôt just hold a number; you own an asset. Why? Because wheat has the potential to fulfill people‚Äôs nutritional needs. It can provide direct benefits to people. Wheat itself stores the potential to provide that benefit. It stores value because it holds that potential. The number ""500"" is merely a way to express the amount of that stored potential. The bigger the number, the greater the potential.

Now, let‚Äôs take another example. Suppose you hold 500 dollars. This, too, is an asset. Why? Because the dollar has the potential to fulfill people's need to pay debt. Every dollar in existence enters circulation as a loan, either through a commercial bank lending money to individuals or businesses or through a central bank purchasing government bonds. These obligations create a real, tangible need for dollars. Individuals and businesses need them, and the U.S. government needs them.

Just as biology creates the need for food, the banking system creates the need for dollars through loan contracts, collateral, and government bonds. Debtors must acquire dollars to settle the obligations they signed. In this way, dollars store the potential to satisfy that need. The dollar itself stores value because it holds the potential to provide what is needed by the debtors in the U.S. banking system. If you hold 500 dollars, you own a specific amount of that potential to benefit debtors. The number '500' is simply a measure of this potential. The greater the number, the greater the potential.

The same principle applies to digital goods. If you hold a collection of music files, e-books, or software, you own assets because these things hold the potential to entertain, inform, or assist with tasks like writing or data analysis. They store value because they hold the potential to provide benefits to people. The more units of these digital goods you hold, the more benefits you can provide.

In the above examples, we saw what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value: it means holding something with the potential to satisfy people's needs and provide a direct benefit.

Now, let‚Äôs compare this to crypto. Crypto systems don‚Äôt have warehouses where they store wheat or any tangible goods. They don‚Äôt produce music, e-books, or software. They don‚Äôt issue loans, take collateral, or deal with government bonds.

What crypto systems do is assign numbers to addresses and record those assignments in a decentralized digital ledger. That‚Äôs literally it. This means that when you hold a number in your wallet, you don‚Äôt own the potential to satisfy people's needs or provide any benefit to them. All you do is hold a number.

If you hold the number 1, your potential to provide benefits to people is zero. If someone else holds the number 1,000,000, their potential is not a million times greater than yours; it is still zero. Both of you own zero potential to provide benefits to people. That‚Äôs why, by holding crypto, you don't own an asset or a store of value. And you certainly don't own money or currency, since those actually store value. Simply put, you hold a number but own nothing.

Crypto holders, recognizing they own nothing, resort to spreading false or misleading narratives in a desperate bid to offload their numbers and acquire assets. One such false narrative is about scarcity. For instance, they point to Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million cap and call it scarcity. But scarcity applies to things that satisfy needs or provide benefits. If you limit the amount of wheat or dollars in circulation, their ability to fulfill people's needs remains. But in crypto, there is nothing that can satisfy people's needs; there's nothing to be scarce, just numbers on a ledger. Therefore, the 21 million cap is not scarcity; it is merely a mathematical rule limiting the sum of numbers assigned to addresses.

An example of a misleading narrative is the supposed simplicity and speed of crypto. This is often touted as one of its appealing qualities, but the reality is that crypto is fast and easy precisely because it doesn't manage any assets. Managing assets is inherently complex.

Take wheat, for example: it requires warehouses, packaging, transportation, harvesting, quality control, and distribution networks to ensure its usability. Dollars, too, involve a complex web of processes, from assessing creditworthiness to drafting loan contracts, securing collateral, regulating banks, and enforcing debt repayment. All of these processes exist because managing something that actually provides benefits to people is far from simple or easy.

In contrast, crypto systems only track which number is assigned to which address. And tracking numbers? That‚Äôs straightforward and easy.

Another false narrative is that value is belief-based, that something is valuable if people believe in it, and if they don't, it's not valuable. But belief cannot change the potential of something to satisfy people‚Äôs needs. Wheat still has the potential to provide nutrition, and dollars still have the potential to settle debts to banks, regardless of what anyone believes. That stored potential is value. The claim that value is based on belief is just another trick crypto holders use to mislead people into giving up assets in exchange for numbers.

No matter how many narratives crypto advocates spin, the fundamental fact remains: they hold numbers but own nothing. Everything positive you‚Äôve ever heard about crypto is just a trick to get ownership of your valuable assets and dump numbers on you.",Life_Ad_2756,2025-02-11 10:38:14,0,CryptoCurrency
Bitcoin Newcomers Faq - Please Read!,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can‚Äôt be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | ŒºBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

I told myself it was a scam, then BTC went from a few thousand to 10 thousand.

When it dropped back down I told myself ‚ÄúI was right!‚Äù

Then BTC made its push to 30k, I said ‚Äúlet me take a look at this‚Äù

I decided there was a second best, and something else would replace BTC‚Ä¶ duh! MySpace was replaced by Facebook!

So I spent thousands on shitcoins.

I lost, I learned, and I figured out why BTC truly is the only coin that matters.

It was mined and distributed fairly, no one knew how far it would go so no one hoarded it. It‚Äôs part of what gives it value (obviously 100 other reasons)

So now I‚Äôm 5yrs in to being fully committed, only buying BTC, and not looking at price.

I truly feel like I‚Äôm set for life (I make good money and only buy BTC) and I still buy because I see the market cap easily crossing 20 trillion.

Bitcoin 2500: A Space-Age Op-Ed,"Many of us here share the thought that Bitcoin is the *end-game of money*; that Bitcoin will be for the next 5000+ years what gold was for the previous 5000.

Only five centuries ago, settlers began to venture across the Atlantic to *the new world.* I wanted to go through a little thought experiment into what Bitcoin will look like just five centuries from now, in the **year 2500**. A future where humanity has spread across the solar system, with settlements on Mars and beyond. **There are many issues that Bitcoin faces in this future**. Does Bitcoin succeed? How would it differ from the Bitcoin of today?

This post will deal a little more with the technical aspects and logistics of a multi-planetary Bitcoin network, so strap-in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is the inability to double-spend coins; the ability to rely on the blockchain as a source of truth. This hinges on the **security and synchronicity** of the blockchain. 

This works fantastic on Earth, as communications across the globe happen near instantaneously - *even at the speed of light*. However, that's not the case when we begin to think about distances in space. The time it takes for light (and any communication) to travel between Earth and Mars ranges from [3 to 22 minutes](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html) depending on where within our respective orbits each planet is. Between Earth and some of the promising moons of gas giants like Europa? over [45 light-minutes](https://spacecenter.org/meet-the-solar-system-europa/#:~:text=Europa%20is%20one%20of%20Jupiter's,45%20minutes%20to%20reach%20Europa). Let's not even get into interstellar space, where travel to the nearest star system is over [4 years away at light-speed](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html).

>**Why is a delay in communication an issue for Bitcoin miners?**

Imagine that you are part of the future colony on Mars and you want to mine Bitcoin. You quickly realize it is impossible. In fact, **mining Bitcoin anywhere other than Earth is impossible.** Why? Because it doesn't matter how fast your mining machines are if you are solving blocks too late. And as mentioned earlier, at 3-22 light-minutes away, Mars' distance from Earth is far enough that you can be multiple blocks behind *at light speed.* 

[No Earthly pool would accept your miner's hashes](https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/from-rejected-to-accepted-tips-for-improving-your-mining-speed) if you are providing the solutions to those hashes a potential **44** minute round-trip later. 

In order for Martian Bitcoin miners to contribute meaningfully, a Mars-based mining pool would be one that can successfully compute enough blocks in the communication gap to outpace the Earth miners, thus having the longer and valid chain. *But wait!* This means that Mars would have successfully 51% attacked the blockchain. So let's not do that, and find another solution.

>**A potential space-age solution to Bitcoin mining.**

Because of the issues that arise with the speed of light, mining Bitcoin in the future will potentially need to be centralized in respect to location. It will be difficult for computers more than a few light-minutes away to meaningfully contribute valid hashes to the network. In fact, *your hash-rate's value scales linearly towards zero as your approach 10 light-minutes away*.

* **0 light minutes away?** Amazing, you can contribute to the network in near real-time and you have the full (approximate) 10 minutes to find the next block's solution.

* **5 light minutes away?** It's feasible to mine, except *your hash-rate is worth half as much* as someone that is 0 light minutes away. Why? because you have approximately half as much time to solve the block in the 10 minute space.

* **10 light minutes away?** Your hash-rate is essentially *worthless* because you will always be attempting to solve an old block. 

This is all theoretical of course, because if you are dealing with mining real estate at the light-minute scale, the energy usage of that compute would be astronomical - *literally.* 

One solution to this energy usage is a hypothetical megastructure known as a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere). An entity that would provide more than enough usable energy for such an endeavour, and it also would be localized enough to enable connected miners to meaningfully contribute to mining.

Maybe a [Kardashev Type II civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) is a little far fetched for our civilization in the year 2500, but anything is possible.

> **What issues would Bitcoin users face?**

Let's revisit that previously mentioned colony on Mars, and instead imagine someone wishes to send you one million sats via L1, the base chain.

How would you perform this transaction so that you can trust it? What if that Bitcoin is sent to a different recipient on Earth at the exact same time as it is sent to you on Mars, and you have no way of knowing for an entire block?

Well, it turns out that **we've already solved this problem on Earth** \- *to an extent.* All that you would need to do is wait for a certain amount of confirmations in order to ensure that your coins were not double-spent and that you are the rightful recipient. This solution works well on Earth, and can even potentially work on Mars.

Although this band-aid solution wont work forever. Those closest-neighbour star systems mentioned earlier are still **4+ lightyears away.** And we can't expect someone in the Proxima Centauri system to wait over 200,000 block confirmations for their transaction, right?

>**A potential solution for space-age Bitcoin users.**

Layers upon layers. That's it really. It's quite obvious at this point that 600,000 transactions per day (the limit of Bitcoin's base chain) can't support hyperbitcoinization tomorrow, let alone in 500 years when our population has continued to grow in size and in distance. 

It may be that each individual civilization has their own layer built upon the blockchain, and that transactions between civilizations must be settled on the basechain as a result. Mars may very well have their own rollup solution, wherein martian settlers are free to transact indefinitely between themselves - *their own lightning network*. Periodically settling back and forth between the main chain to top-up as needed. In this instance, you could accept that previously mentioned 1 million sats from your fellow settler easily because you need not be wary about a double-spend back on Earth, since it is agreed upon by the network that those sats are within your own layer, removing any light-speed communication issues.

>**Why does any of this even matter?**

It's very obvious that alternative stores of value will be worth much less in the distant future. Precious metals are found in abundance within asteroids in our solar system, and there are already ventures that aim to one day harvest these minerals. What value will precious metals have if we are able to capture a [single asteroid worth $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000](https://www.space.com/psyche-metal-asteroid-composition)?

**Physical store-of-value assets become worthless in an age of such abundance**, and thus Bitcoin, as a truly scarce digital asset will reign supreme. These aforementioned smaller logistical hurdles will just need to be resolved before then.

As I mentioned in a previous Op-ed on this sub, it's important for us to try to envision future problems that might arise with Bitcoin, irregardless of how far away they are. If we want to build a future-proof, resilient asset, we can not just be concerned with what issues may arise in the next decade. There are investors today that view Bitcoin as a cross-generational asset for themselves and their families. 

I wrote about this topic very briefly in my [Bitcoin 2048 Op-ed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ijhcth/btc_2048_hyperbitcoinization_oped/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but it was a lot of fun envisioning Bitcoin in the far-future that I wanted to explore this idea more in depth.

Does it affect the results if i put in 20 dollars a week VS 80 $ every month when my paycheck comes in? I think it would be easier for me to invest more at once than a little at a time.",minibanana563,2025-02-11 06:48:10,13,Bitcoin
What Would The Process Look Like For Full Us/World Adoption To Bitcoin Standard?,"Is this the end game? If so, how would this happen in an ethical moral way? My concern is that almost all bitcoin is owned by an extremely small number of people. Based on the numbers I‚Äôm seeing, roughly 100 million addresses own about 90% of bitcoin. I‚Äôm sure this is less than 100 million people since many hold multiple address. This is less than 1% of the population. The numbers are more extreme as you go down. About 15k addresses own 60% of bitcoin which is 0.0002% of world population. If we transition to full bitcoin standard will there be an elite ruling class? The only ethical way I can think of is if everyone‚Äôs wealth is converted to bitcoin in a weighted fashion so people across the world maintain their current wealth. Am I missing something here?",robbybobby89,2025-02-11 15:59:01,3,Bitcoin

Just How Secure Exactly?,"Bitcoin's network hashrate is reaching new ATHs. Breaking ***1 Zettahash per second*** has become so commonplace that it can escape our minds on just how insane that number truly is.

1 Zettahash, 1000 Million Terahashes, **1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10\^****^(21)****) hashes** is a number so unfathomable that we can take the security of Bitcoin's blockchain for granted.

Earth has approximately **10\^18** individual grains of sand across all of it's beaches and oceans.

>**Every single second, the amount of mining calculations collectively done by the network outnumbers the number of grains of sand on earth by a factor of one thousand.**

But it is so much greater than that. This is just the amount of hashes that happens per second. Let's extrapolate a little further.

If each block requires approximately 10 minutes of compute to find a solution, that means it takes approximately 600 seconds of this network hashrate to find a solution. That's over **600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000** hashes to find one single solution, or **6\*10\^23** **hashes.**

How big is this number? Well the number of stars in the entire observable universe is on the order of **7\*10\^22** **stars.**

>**Every single block added to the blockchain is protected by more individual calculations than the number of stars in the entire known universe by a factor of ten.**

Ok, lets do the hail Mary. How many hashes have ever been calculated for the Bitcoin network? Well using [historical Bitcoin hashrate charts](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate) and a little bit of calculus, it's easy to get a quick estimate!

As of February 2025, **5.45\*10\^28** **hashes have been approximately computed by miners since the dawn of Bitcoin.**

That's 54.5 Billion Exahashes, 54.5 Million Zettahash, 54,500 Yottahash, or **54.5** [**Ronnahash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_prefix)**.**

This is approximately the same amount as the observable universe is wide. ***in centimeters*****.**

Bitcoiners Are The Most Prepared Individualists For The Potential Economic Collapse,"*I made this post in r/singularity I think it is relevant here too.

**Jobs, Automation and Debt**

The argument is simple, the vast majority of the work force in the knowledge economy are in some kind of debt, student debt, mortgage, credit card debt and the list goes on. With technological exponential growth the majority of knowledge workers are about to lose their livelihoods.

The effect is probably going to be greater than what we experienced in 2008. It will be the great economic depression of this century. People can't repay the debts, banks collapse, and with that all the economy. The question is where is the line, 10% unemployment of knowledge workers, 15%, 20%?

With the collapse of the banks, as was in 2008, bailouts once again will be approved. By bailouts we mean printing fiat money out of thin air and giving it away, which eventually leads to hyperinflation.

So, mass layoffs are about to happen in in the next few years and with that we can logically expect collapse of the banks and hyperinflation. Which means collapse of the dollar/euro.

This is the transition period, and it is going to be hard. I really much hope I am wrong, but the logic says otherwise.",agihypothetical,2025-02-11 12:42:24,5,Bitcoin

Keeping Bitcoin Safe,"Hi everyone, 

I was wondering which cold wallet are you guys using? 

I heard about Tangem and Ledger or even Jade. 

Ledger had some problems in the recent past with low-quality battery materials. 

Which one should I use to keep my Bitcoin safe for the next 20 years? 

Do you think we might have to buy every 5 years a new cold wallet to be safer and updated?",youngsaul8,2025-02-11 19:44:48,0,Bitcoin

I Hate The Banking System,"I've saved up some money in a HYSA, the interest rate of the Citi Accelerated Savings has currently dropped below what the money market is paying. So i went to move the money to Fidelity, and you can only move ""X"" amount per day from Citi...
And now I'm on day 3 of waiting for my ""daily limit"".. (I haven't transferred anything in 3 days) to reset, so i don't know how i can be over my daily limit because i haven't transferred anything in 3 days!! 

And even when transferring into Fidelity, i can't do it at once.. what the hell?! Where is my money? I hate zero reserve banking. I wouldn't have this issue with BTC it seems, I've transferred larger amounts without delays in the past.  Sorry just venting, it's my money and i want it now!",ekfah,2025-02-10 20:43:40,30,Bitcoin

Sometimes Compromise Is Necessary Re: Bitcoin,"I've attained a .2 btc stack in the last four years, in dribs and drabs.  I know it's not much, but I'm proud of it.  But I have three kids and want each one to have .2 btc each.  So I need another .4 before it skyrockets.

The wife has been with me on my stacking thus far.  Not really into it but letting me play since it's my money and I support the family well.  But... when I told her I wanted to take out a 40K loan to get the other .4, she balked.  No way, she said.  I'm crazy, she said.

So I told her, then if you'll let me take out 50K so I can get up to .7, then when it hits 500K I'll sell off a .16 to get all our money back and pay off the loan.

Leaving my kids with .54 (.18 apiece instead of .2).

Yeah I wanted them each to have a .2, but compromise is important in a marriage.

SHE SAID YES.  She still rolled her eyes but she said yes.  That woman is a Godsend.

COMPROMISE FOLKS.

p.s.  If it ever hits 500K I will try to get her to go along with not paying off the loan with it.  I think once she sees it go from 100K to 500K she'll be onboard with letting it RIIIIIDE.",afscam,2025-02-11 16:53:43,0,Bitcoin

Help Me Understand,"I'm in the process of DOYR and i'm trying to really understand from a technical POV the technology. I have a decent knowledge and i have an engineering degree that allows me to be comfortable with the Maths behind btc. After browsing through many forums i can't wrap my head around the collision problem:
I'm trying to understand how one could ""steal"" bitcoin from an unknown wallet.
Here is what i understand:

-There are 2e256 private keys

-There are 2e160 addresses associated (160bit hash result) Therefore there are 2e96 private keys for each public address
1rst problem: if i send btc to one of these addresses: will 2^96 wallets recieve it?

2nd problem: why do some people claim that you only need to bruteforce 2e160 adresses to succesfully ""steal"" btc as finding an adress is useless
My understanding is that you would have to brute force 2e256 keys to find one (actually less bcs of birthday paradox) because the only way of being able to manipulate btc is through the private key.
