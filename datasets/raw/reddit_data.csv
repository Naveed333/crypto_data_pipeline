"[AMA] Giveaway with Portal to Bitcoin: Making bridges, wrapped coins, and external custody obsolete - Feb 12","Hey r/cryptocurrency!

We’re Portal to Bitcoin, the first fully custodyless, cross-chain infrastructure built for Bitcoin. Using our BitScaler architecture, we enable native-to-native asset transfers across blockchains without the security risks of bridges, wrapped assets or centralized custody.

What We’re Solving:

1. Truly decentralized cross-chain transactions with no wrapped assets, vaults or multi-sig risks
2. Fast, low-cost swaps secured by Bitcoin, the most capital-rich blockchain & what we believe to be the fundamental monetary layer
3. Seamless DeFi access with a UX rivaling CEXs and fully self-custodied
4. Sustainable liquidity incentives through a first-of-its-kind Bitcoin AMM
5. Barriers to Americans from participating in incentivization campaigns.

Who’s Here?

Our team at Portal to Bitcoin has been building on Bitcoin for a long time and is backed by Arrington Capital, Coinbase Ventures, [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) and OKX Ventures.

"Nasdaq Files to List XRP ETF, Stating XRP Is Hard to Manipulate","Article in summary:
Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

What's up with these tap to earn tokens ?,"
Lately, I keep seeing these ""tap to earn"" apps everywhere basically, you tap the screen, watch ads, or do random tasks to earn some kind of crypto or in-game token. At first, it seems like an easy way to stack up some extra cash, but after messing around with a few, I’m starting to think it’s mostly a waste of time. But at the other end we can even make money lol if good luck. 
I’ve noticed The payouts are tiny. You’d have to grind for weeks just to make a few bucks.
Withdrawal limits are insane. A lot of these apps won’t let you cash out until you hit some ridiculous threshold that most people will never reach.
Way too many ads. Half the time, you’re just watching endless ads for the chance to earn a few cents.
Some of them seem sketchy. A few apps never actually pay out, or they disappear after hyping up their tokens.
I feel like these apps are just farming user engagement and ad revenue while making it seem like you're earning something. Has anyone actually made decent money from one of these, or are they all just a trap? Curious to hear real experiences. Recently came accross tapswap. Before it was ton and midas yield which i tried . But kinda confused because So many are still coming in market.

"Tether transfer from abroad, taxes?","Hi there, noob in crypto here. Sorry if my English is bad sometimes. 

Tl;dr in advance: What’s the taxation on receiving about $1800 worth of tether on average monthly, from my brother in Turkey to me in the US? 

Here’s my situation and I’m trying to understand what sort of taxation I might have to deal with. 

I have assets abroad (in Turkey specifically) but I reside in the US (non-citizen, legal resident) and I want to transfer my monthly passive income that I have back there to here. It’s not much, about $1600 to $1900 each month. Using the regular bank to bank transfers I end up using about $1200 or more in a year due to horrible exchange rates and the fees. So my brother who’s a crypto enthusiast suggested that I use this method: 

I send him my Turkish Lira each month, he buys tether and transfers it to me in the US, and I transfer that into my regular bank account. So  basically a transfer from my Turkish bank account to my US bank account through a longer but supposedly cheaper way. That part seems to be accurate, but I’m wondering what my obligations are in terms of taxes. As far as chatgpt tells me, since it’s a transfer within family it can be considered a “gift”, and if it doesn’t exceed the $18,000 annual gift tax exclusion, it’ll be fine. But it does exceed the $18,000 limit. So will I be taxed on the amount after that limit, or does the whole total of transfer then gets deemed not a gift and get taxed? Also other than that, is there anything else that I need to consider?

Many thanks in advance to all who try to help. Happy gaining to you. ",sultanamana,1739298155.0,0,CryptoCurrency

Would this cryptocurrency idea work?,"TL;DR: Cryptocurrency with a built-in private messaging app. Messages cost one coin, and the coin is designed to be cheap due to high supply. Mining secures the network.


So I was thinking of this cryptocurrency idea but I'm not sure if it will work since no one seems to have tried to make it.


Basically, a cryptocurrency with an app that people could buy and sell the coin. Within the app, users have the ability to send messages to other users or wallet addresses using one coin as a fee per message. 


The messaging future will be decentralized and private, which is the core utility of cryptocurrency.


The coin will have a relatively high supply to make the coin price low so the fee per message can be manageable.


The coin can be bought original mined; the miners will receive coins from mining and a bit more from mining fees.


The electricity used from the miners will keep the network up.",adison822,1739299113.0,0,CryptoCurrency
crypto taxes for a beginner,"Hi everyone, I have some questions for the more experienced:

1) I got two AirDrops, about 1k each, sold on the same day, on one I lost $50 and on the other I made $100 profit, how should I report them?

2) I invested example: 5k in Solana, now I have a total value of 15k in sol… I decide to sell 2k do I have to declare it anyway, even if it is less than what I invested and it is not a capital gain?

3) I have been DCA BTC for the past 3 years, small transactions of $100 a week, sold everything! 
but one of the exchanges I bought from no longer shows me how many BTC I bought and at what price…

I can declare like this: I invested 10,000, I sell for 15,000…15,000-1000=5,000 profit and I pay taxes!  Or do I always have to report the details of each individual transaction, the dates, etc.?

Nobel Economist Labels Bitcoin “A Financial Black Hole”,""" Eugene F. Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, sees zero value in Bitcoin, calling it nothing but an empty vacuum.

Appearing on the Capitalis’t podcast, Eugene Fama delivered his verdict: Bitcoin is doomed. While the crypto world has heard plenty of these eulogies before, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds.

Fama ridiculed the idea of a blockchain-based financial system, likening it to boiling soup over a fire made from plastic bottles—expensive, inefficient, and environmentally reckless. He sees Bitcoin as a wild card in monetary theory, unpredictable and undeserving of attention. And the idea that it’s “digital gold”? He’s not buying it. 

“Cryptocurrencies are such a puzzle because they violate all the rules of a medium of exchange,” Fama said. “They don't have a stable real value. They have highly variable real value. That kind of a medium of exchange is not supposed to survive,” he concluded.""

*Is E. Fama right about Bitcoin being worthless, or is he way off? What do you think guys?*

"Your thoughts on the ""stable"" coin USDN","I recently came across a new stable coin called USDN offered by a decentralized exchange platform named Smardex. It appears that they have a feature which allows users to swap Ethereum and potentially USDT to their proprietary stable coin, USDN. This caught my interest, and I’m curious if anyone else has encountered this before?

What makes USDN particularly intriguing is their advertised 58% APR just for holding the coin in your wallet. This is quite an attractive proposition, and it has piqued my interest significantly. However, I am a bit cautious, as it sounds almost too good to be true. I would like to give it a try, but I want to ensure it's a sound investment and not something that might lead me into complications or unforeseen issues down the line.

From what I understand, there are two main avenues to acquire USDN: you can either mint new USDN coins or swap existing cryptocurrencies to USDN. The prospect of such high returns is tempting, yet it’s crucial to assess the reliability and legitimacy of Smardex and their offerings. Before taking the plunge, I would like to gather more insights from others who might have experience with USDN to determine whether it’s genuinely worth the risk, or if it would be wiser to approach this offer with caution.

"Cboe BZX submits filings for XRP ETFs from Bitwise, WisdomTree, Canary, and 21Shares.","Looks like the hype for xrp is gonna huge this bull run. 
Cboe BZX Exchange has filed requests with U.S. regulators to launch the first spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On February 6, the exchange submitted filings for four asset managers Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs would track the price of XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.
These filings notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about a proposed rule change. If approved, these would be the first XRP ETFs in the U.S.

Earlier, under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum were approved in early 2024.

Now, with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who is seen as more supportive of crypto, there has been an increase in crypto-related ETF filings. Analysts believe issuers are testing what new crypto products the SEC, possibly influenced by a Trump administration, might approve.

I think we are now getting a lot of adoption and attention towards crypto . Many more expectations from other major exchanges like bitget and kucoin regarding etfs.

"The crazy world of crypto, It's only getting worse","  
Crypto has been through ups and downs but honestly since 2017 when layer two tokens for Ethereum took off and DeFi came into existence it's only gotten more wild.

  
I'd have to say at least the first part of what would be considered a fun meme coin project would have been DOGE at least one that really took off and became one of the most adopted token. This was back in 2014, and before that I would say most projects where legitimate cases of blockchain such as litecoin.

From there things fell rather quite for a while until 2017 when Ethereum layer two tokens really took off. This layer two token system opened up a lot of possibilities but it also opened up a lot of failed projects and yes scam investments.

From there we then moved into 2020-2021 with the introduction of Meme coins, DeFi and NFT a rather large growth in terms of amount of projects and people getting involved.

 Now we are in 2024-2025 bull run and we have a lot of the same crazy going on but at a whole new level. We have meme coin crazy, scams, rug pulls, DeFi hacks, Layer two token projects, NFTs, web3, gaming and more. It's gotten so big now that not everything goes up.

I haven’t been able to find an exchange that supports it, and after the success of Trading212’s Pies, I find it a bit weird no crypto exchanges tried to capture the concept, specially given the importance of having a diversified portfolio when it comes to crypto currency.",migueels,1739234726.0,1,CryptoCurrency

Can customers actually do XRP-based money transfers through conventional banks?,"I'm from a country with a very archaic and anti-competitive banking system. From what I've read, at least one chain of major national banks has some affiliation to XRP, but I haven't seen anything about how to do faster and less expensive money transfers via XRP from that bank. XRP isn't mentioned anywhere on its website, and that got me wondering how banks even refer to XRP-based money transfers - to the extent that they acknowledge XRP or crypto to their customers at all.

Do any banks where you live actually let you transfer fiat money via XRP? If so, do they refer to such transactions as ""wire transfers,"" ""XRP money transfers,"" or something different? Also, wouldn't both the sending bank AND the receiving bank need to support XRP for this sort of transfer to go through?",bje332013,1739149925.0,66,CryptoCurrency

An actual use of cryptocurrency, yet many journalists, crypto news breakers don’t report about it. 

The government at the moment is very hot on stable coins, yet we now have the company telcoin that can now legally issue dollar backed stablecoins. They are planning for the US dollar, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, etc. the biggest remittance corridors there are, and yet we don’t spread the news? I mean, this is tech! Actual adoption and use of crypto. I just don’t get how they don’t have the CT backing or support from more people. It’s an older company that survived bear markets and is still building and it’s at its peak potential right now. And I haven even talked about telecoms, the telcoin network, and how the token is used in the systems they are soon releasing.

Polygon & the Super Bowl: From Reddit Avatars to Polymarket’s $14M Bet,"Today I crossed with this interesting [Tweet ](https://x.com/p_petertherock/status/1888697925423055196)sharing data regarding the NFL Super Bowl on Polygon.

As you may know, two years ago Reddit had a Reddit Collectible Avatars marketing campaign for the NFL Super Bowl LVII and they gifted event related avatars to the users that claimed them. Like this one:

https://preview.redd.it/otzpr7cxe9ie1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c11a4bcb1012357f0045a9d85d05fa4b335dfe3

This whole event minted 2,124,854M Collectible avatars on Polygon Network. Unfortunately Reddit next year's Superbowl tried something similar but making them too expensive and not achieving that great success.

https://preview.redd.it/c8bpje8ye9ie1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cab97c93ac7dbe580b8c5584b3c01b2ac694c6c

This year unfortunately Reddit didn't organized any kind of Superbowl Reddit Collectible avatars related event but this time we have another protagonist, Polymarket.

Polymarket is making Polygon once again the center of the action in this Super Bowl LIX with $14 million in active positions across 478 Super Bowl related markets.

https://preview.redd.it/8f4j0vcze9ie1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d8ea4f64ae9bf83243e247b50eab8bb720ee9d0

Polymarket is having +$414M in betting volume as you can see in the image below.

https://preview.redd.it/0ezm6db0f9ie1.png?width=2866&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ed80ca307de721aead71c5cc9a0fadedeb4a61

Polygon continues to cement its presence at the NFL Super Bowl, and this time, it’s through **Polymarket**, the popular decentralized prediction market.

https://preview.redd.it/ufc4f8yoa9ie1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac766257a4ac5282666da10bacf6056bb6815594

Polymarket is really gamblers paradise xD

With all of this I just want to show that Polygon has probably one of the most used real use of cases even if it is a casino and its bringing a lot of money and people to Polygon ecosystem building a unstoppable ecosystem that pushes adoption in crypto. And this is just the beginning because one AggLayer starts being operative it will be easier than ever to move money between layers to participate on fun dApps like Polymarket. Polygon is about to wake up.

Why Everything Positive You've Heard About Crypto Is a Trick,"
When you ask a crypto holder what they actually own in the amount shown in their wallet, they will likely say something like ""an asset"" or ""a store of value."" But that’s not true. The fact is, they own nothing. They hold a number but own nothing.

To understand why, let’s first clarify what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value.

Imagine you are holding 500 units of wheat. In this case, you don’t just hold a number; you own an asset. Why? Because wheat has the potential to fulfill people’s nutritional needs. It can provide direct benefits to people. Wheat itself stores the potential to provide that benefit. It stores value because it holds that potential. The number ""500"" is merely a way to express the amount of that stored potential. The bigger the number, the greater the potential.

Now, let’s take another example. Suppose you hold 500 dollars. This, too, is an asset. Why? Because the dollar has the potential to fulfill people's need to pay debt. Every dollar in existence enters circulation as a loan, either through a commercial bank lending money to individuals or businesses or through a central bank purchasing government bonds. These obligations create a real, tangible need for dollars. Individuals and businesses need them, and the U.S. government needs them.

Just as biology creates the need for food, the banking system creates the need for dollars through loan contracts, collateral, and government bonds. Debtors must acquire dollars to settle the obligations they signed. In this way, dollars store the potential to satisfy that need. The dollar itself stores value because it holds the potential to provide what is needed by the debtors in the U.S. banking system. If you hold 500 dollars, you own a specific amount of that potential to benefit debtors. The number '500' is simply a measure of this potential. The greater the number, the greater the potential.

The same principle applies to digital goods. If you own a collection of music files, e-books, or software, you own assets because these things hold the potential to entertain, inform, or assist with tasks like writing or data analysis. They store value because they hold the potential to provide benefits to people. The more units of these digital goods you hold, the more benefits you can provide.

In the above examples, we saw what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value: it means holding something with the potential to satisfy people's needs and provide a direct benefit.

Now, let’s compare this to crypto. Crypto systems don’t have warehouses where they store wheat or any tangible goods. They don’t produce music, e-books, or software. They don’t issue loans, take collateral, or deal with government bonds.

What crypto systems do is assign numbers to addresses and record those assignments in a decentralized digital ledger. That’s literally it. This means that when you hold a number in your wallet, you don’t own the potential to satisfy people's needs or provide any benefit to them. All you do is hold a number.

If you hold the number 1, your potential to provide benefits to people is zero. If someone else holds the number 1,000,000, their potential is not a million times greater than yours; it is still zero. Both of you own zero potential to provide benefits to people. That’s why, by holding crypto, you don't own an asset or a store of value. And you certainly don't own money or currency, since those actually store value. Simply put, you hold a number but own nothing.

Crypto holders, recognizing they own nothing, resort to spreading false or misleading narratives in a desperate bid to offload their numbers and acquire assets. One such false narrative is about scarcity. For instance, they point to Bitcoin’s 21 million cap and call it scarcity. But scarcity applies to things that satisfy needs or provide benefits. If you limit the amount of wheat or dollars in circulation, their ability to fulfill people's needs remains. But in crypto, there is nothing that can satisfy people's needs; there's nothing to be scarce, just numbers on a ledger. Therefore, the 21 million cap is not scarcity; it is merely a mathematical rule limiting the sum of numbers assigned to addresses.

An example of a misleading narrative is the supposed simplicity and speed of crypto. This is often touted as one of its appealing qualities, but the reality is that crypto is fast and easy precisely because it doesn't manage any assets. Managing assets is inherently complex.

Take wheat, for example: it requires warehouses, packaging, transportation, harvesting, quality control, and distribution networks to ensure its usability. Dollars, too, involve a complex web of processes, from assessing creditworthiness to drafting loan contracts, securing collateral, regulating banks, and enforcing debt repayment. All of these processes exist because managing something that actually provides benefits to people is far from simple or easy.

In contrast, crypto systems only track which number is assigned to which address. And tracking numbers? That’s straightforward and easy.

Another false narrative is that value is belief-based, that something is valuable if people believe in it, and if they don't, it's not valuable. But belief cannot change the potential of something to satisfy people’s needs. Wheat still has the potential to provide nutrition, and dollars still have the potential to settle debts to banks, regardless of what anyone believes. That stored potential is value. The claim that value is based on belief is just another trick crypto holders use to mislead people into giving up assets in exchange for numbers.

No matter how many narratives crypto advocates spin, the fundamental fact remains: they hold numbers but own nothing. Everything positive you’ve ever heard about crypto is just a trick to get ownership of your valuable assets and dump numbers on you.",Life_Ad_2756,1739270294.0,0,CryptoCurrency

I regret not buying Solana in 2020,"I’m currently fixated on the fact that I didn’t invest in Solana in 2020 when it first released. I had $20,000 to my name at the time. I could’ve put $10,000 into Solana and made $2,000,000+. I hate that I’m getting into crypto now. I should have a long time ago. I no longer have that kind of money. I hate having to go to school and get a 9-5. I’m dealing with mental illness so everything is difficult.

I’m currently unemployed, depressed and hopeless. Living with my mom at 28. I don’t mean to sound like this, I just I’m really struggling to accept the fact that it never happened. And it may never happen in my life. 

I currently fantasize of what I would do with all the money. How my quality of life would be 10x better than what it is today. If only I would’ve know. And yet, I don’t know a single person who invested in Solana that early and is a multimillionaire. It’s a terrible intrusive thought that won’t leave me. 

But can someone please help me get over this thought and move forward with my life? It really is impacting so negatively. How do I get over this obsessive thought? It’s really ruining my quality of life 24/7. ",Tough_Ad_6806,1739254291.0,0,CryptoCurrency

"Tether CEO ""All people alive ... will move to new QUANTUM-RESISTANT addresses”","He's correct- the transition has to happen.    
  
But apparently he doesn't see an issue with 20-25% of supply (lost wallets) being taken by quantum computing.  

That's quite the rosy take on it.  I'd imagine smart money would exit ahead of this for 3 reasons.    
  
Potential panic as wallets ""wake up"" at an alarming rate.    
Potential panic at what the price impact could be.    
Potential panic of people worrying others will panic.

  
I actually think there is a much better approach - that I've written about before.    
  
I was told it was a bad idea.  My guess is people either didn't get it, or didn't like the idea that quantum computing requires solutions, starting now to properly be ready without disruption.

This certainly is not a narrative, it isn't FUD.    
  
The biggest players in the world recognize it- and that includes the CEO of Tether.

Let's stop trying to spin it, ignore it, or assume it will be managed.  The time to deal with it is now.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

My concern is that almost all bitcoin is owned by an extremely small number of people. Based on the numbers I’m seeing, roughly 100 million addresses own about 90% of bitcoin. I’m sure this is less than 100 million people since many hold multiple address. This is less than 1% of the population. The numbers are more extreme as you go down. About 15k addresses own 60% of bitcoin which is 0.0002% of world population. If we transition to full bitcoin standard will there be an elite ruling class? The only ethical way I can think of is if everyone’s wealth is converted to bitcoin in a weighted fashion so people across the world maintain their current wealth. Am I missing something here?",robbybobby89,1739289541.0,4,Bitcoin

Just How Secure Exactly?,"Bitcoin's network hashrate is reaching new ATHs. Breaking ***1 Zettahash per second*** has become so commonplace that it can escape our minds on just how insane that number truly is.

1 Zettahash, 1000 Million Terahashes, **1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10\^****^(21)****) hashes** is a number so unfathomable that we can take the security of Bitcoin's blockchain for granted.

Earth has approximately **10\^18** individual grains of sand across all of it's beaches and oceans.

>**Every single second, the amount of mining calculations collectively done by the network outnumbers the number of grains of sand on earth by a factor of one thousand.**

But it is so much greater than that. This is just the amount of hashes that happens per second. Let's extrapolate a little further.

If each block requires approximately 10 minutes of compute to find a solution, that means it takes approximately 600 seconds of this network hashrate to find a solution. That's over **600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000** hashes to find one single solution, or **6\*10\^23** **hashes.**

How big is this number? Well the number of stars in the entire observable universe is on the order of **7\*10\^22** **stars.**

>**Every single block added to the blockchain is protected by more individual calculations than the number of stars in the entire known universe by a factor of ten.**

Ok, lets do the hail Mary. How many hashes have ever been calculated for the Bitcoin network? Well using [historical Bitcoin hashrate charts](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate) and a little bit of calculus, it's easy to get a quick estimate!

As of February 2025, **5.45\*10\^28** **hashes have been approximately computed by miners since the dawn of Bitcoin.**

That's 54.5 Billion Exahashes, 54.5 Million Zettahash, 54,500 Yottahash, or **54.5** [**Ronnahash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_prefix)**.**

This is approximately the same amount as the observable universe is wide. ***in centimeters*****.**

Bitcoiners are the most prepared individualists for the potential economic collapse,"*I made this post in r/singularity I think it is relevant here too.

**Jobs, Automation and Debt**

The argument is simple, the vast majority of the work force in the knowledge economy are in some kind of debt, student debt, mortgage, credit card debt and the list goes on. With technological exponential growth the majority of knowledge workers are about to lose their livelihoods.

The effect is probably going to be greater than what we experienced in 2008. It will be the great economic depression of this century. People can't repay the debts, banks collapse, and with that all the economy. The question is where is the line, 10% unemployment of knowledge workers, 15%, 20%?

With the collapse of the banks, as was in 2008, bailouts once again will be approved. By bailouts we mean printing fiat money out of thin air and giving it away, which eventually leads to hyperinflation.

So, mass layoffs are about to happen in in the next few years and with that we can logically expect collapse of the banks and hyperinflation. Which means collapse of the dollar/euro.

This is the transition period, and it is going to be hard. I really much hope I am wrong, but the logic says otherwise.",agihypothetical,1739277744.0,2,Bitcoin

Sometimes Compromise is Necessary RE: Bitcoin,"I've attained a .2 btc stack in the last four years, in dribs and drabs.  I know it's not much, but I'm proud of it.  But I have three kids and want each one to have .2 btc each.  So I need another .4 before it skyrockets.

The wife has been with me on my stacking thus far.  Not really into it but letting me play since it's my money and I support the family well.  But... when I told her I wanted to take out a 40K loan to get the other .4, she balked.  No way, she said.  I'm crazy, she said.

So I told her, then if you'll let me take out 50K so I can get up to .7, then when it hits 500K I'll sell off a .16 to get all our money back and pay off the loan.

Leaving my kids with .54 (.18 apiece instead of .2).

Yeah I wanted them each to have a .2, but compromise is important in a marriage.

SHE SAID YES.  She still rolled her eyes but she said yes.  That woman is a Godsend.

COMPROMISE FOLKS.

p.s.  If it ever hits 500K I will try to get her to go along with not paying off the loan with it.  I think once she sees it go from 100K to 500K she'll be onboard with letting it RIIIIIDE.",afscam,1739292823.0,0,Bitcoin

Help me understand,"I'm in the process of DOYR and i'm trying to really understand from a technical POV the technology. I have a decent knowledge and i have an engineering degree that allows me to be comfortable with the Maths behind btc. After browsing through many forums i can't wrap my head around the collision problem:
I'm trying to understand how one could ""steal"" bitcoin from an unknown wallet.
Here is what i understand:

-There are 2e256 private keys

-There are 2e160 addresses associated (160bit hash result) Therefore there are 2e96 private keys for each public address
1rst problem: if i send btc to one of these addresses: will 2^96 wallets recieve it?

2nd problem: why do some people claim that you only need to bruteforce 2e160 adresses to succesfully ""steal"" btc as finding an adress is useless
My understanding is that you would have to brute force 2e256 keys to find one (actually less bcs of birthday paradox) because the only way of being able to manipulate btc is through the private key.

In the past when I wanted to use some coins I'd simply export the private key tied to one of the addresses in the offline wallet, then import it into an online wallet so I'm only ever exposing a small amount at once. However, for security reasons Bitcoin Core moved to descriptors, which no longer allow this.

Market Manipulation.,"I know enough about bitcoin to get myself in trouble but admit I’m not very well educated on all the ends and outs. My only concerns with bitcoin are large whales. I believe the top 1% of holders have 90% of all bitcoin, similar to most flawed economies; how is this not considered a huge conflict for the overall value? Just like the stock market they hold enough volume to manipulate the overall price of bc, and although I’m certain they would never offload I’m positive they have agreements between each other to buy/sell at specific price points to inflate the overall value.
